3,Floors in lobby need to be cleaned and waxed no AC in the elevator or hallways transient lady asked me for money in the lobby!,Ok for one nights stay...,A verified traveler
4,I stayed 4 nights while attending a conference elsewhere in the D.C. area. I was looking for reasonable price in the D.C. area and proximity to the Metro. The hotel met both needs. They provided a complimentary shuttle to the Metro (although I chose the 20 minute one time just for exercise). There were several good restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the fish restaurant nearby very much. I also chose fast food one night -- all within walking distance. I plan to stay there on a subsequent visit. I enjoyed the complimentary eggs and sausage each morning. (They had cereal also.) They are a little weak on facility maintenance but the room I had was fine.,I'll Stay Again,Bruce

3,We just stayed one night but my boyfriend said there was an odor when he first went in. It wasn't a bad hotel. It just needs to updating.,Okay for one night,A verified traveler
2,"It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel.",Water stains is a no go.,Alex K

3,"The looby of the area was very busy. Only one clerk at desk. Took awhile to check-in. However, the room was nice. The bed comfortable. Nice restaurants in walking distance. I would stay there again.",Great value,seasoned traveler
4,"Overall it was pretty good...the staff were excellent..the free breakfast was GREAT. However, the shower didn't produce cold water until the 3rd person took a shower. Also, we didn't have a refridgerator in the room, so left overs from resturants were out of the question. But loved to have the ability to take a shuttle to the Metro Station, that then took me the DC so I didn't have to drive for a tour of DC. GREAT!!!",Not A Bad Stay,Family Vacation
3,"It was great had a reasonable breakfast,could improve on breakfast menus!",Weekend stay,Winette
4,We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff the shuttle service was fantastic! Only a couple of minutes away from a Metro Station the hotel provides regular service to/from every 30 minutes or on demand. Very nice buffet breakfast. Hotel room was clean very comfortable.

5,I have always loves this hotel. Besides being close to the highway for easy assess to all the areas attractions. It is tucked away for peace of mind.,the perfect staycation,A verified traveler
3,"This is a very nice property for tourists, but business travelers should look elsewhere. The internet service is very poor. So, if you have to work in your room at night and require internet access, this will not be a good choice for you. Also, I have never been to a hotel that does not get NBC on the TV - one of the major networks. I was going to inform the management of my concerns, but when I checked out, no one asked me how was your stay, so I didn't bother.",Not for the business traveler,WRC
4,"The shuttle to the station wasn't always as available as implied, however it was quite an easy walk. If you have a UK mobile calling for the shuttle for a return trip from the station could be a problem but there were pay phones available. When we first went to our allocated room we were disappointed to have a brick wall just a few feet from the window. Upon request we were immediately moved to another room. The two minor problems we had with the room (safe and iron) were rectified quickly. In view of other comments we found the breakfast to be really disappointing and eventually decided to eat elsewhere. A car for a week is cheaper than a taxi to and from Dulles airport.",Car a benefit in this location,syanne

2,"The Hotel itself is nice and fairly clean. However, booked the hotel months ago and when we arrived, which was late and after 12am, we were told that our twin room was not available, they had sold it, and we could have a double room with 1 bed. They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too. The hotel changed the room the following night, but no compensation, apart from a free drink which we had to fight for as well, were offered.",Disappointed with the Service,Mr Hammer
4,"Ideale per visitare Washington, la zona e gradevole e ci sono dei ristorantini, nonche fast food, per cenare di sera.

2,I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The room was small and had a smell that cannot be described. The breakfast that is included is not the greatest.,Hot smell,A verified traveler
2,I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. .,"Business Hotel, Not for family-environment hotel",Jose

3,"The housekeepers were so loud that when taking a nap with my do not disturb sign out, they were yelling outside often door so loudly that I heard them over the hum of the heater and tv on low that I had on to ironically drown out noise. When I called to complain that the housekeepers were yelling Down the hall at each other, the staff just laughed and said sorry. Also- upon check out- there were there cop cars at the hotel and one cop at the front desk discussing an incident. Didn't make me feel safe.",Ok stay,A verified traveler
4,We used hotel's free shuttle service to the Metro station daily during our vacation. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable. We noticed two negatives in the room: the paint in bathroom was pealing badly and the tub did not drain well the first day. We reported the drain issue and they fixed it while we were away the next day. We had stayed at this hotel 3 years ago and we will likely stay here again in the future.,Convenient and good value,Mary

3,"part of the hotel look great and updated, but the room needed a major renovation. carpet was dirty and wrinkled (could trip on it), and the bathroom was dingy: white enamel broken off on bathtub, toilet paper holder coming off the wall, dirty shower curtain, etc. but the bed was relatively comfy and the hotel quiet when we stayed there. complimentary shuttle to metro station was very convenient. staff was not very friendly and we could not order anything at the bar because there wasn't anyone there (bartender at some point was eating nearby in the lobby but did not acknowledge us and at other times the bar was empty).",convenient to metro but in need of update,A verified traveler
4,"Hotel is very nice, but I waited an hour at the metro station for the hotel shuttle bus. I called the hotel twice to ascertain the shuttle's whereabouts, but the shuttle's location remained a mystery. Perhaps it was someone's dinner break I would have walked, it isn't that far, but this was shortly after the big snow storm.",Shuttle Bus from Metro is a Unicorn,A verified traveler

4,"Most probably I would give it a excellent review if it was not for the service obtained on Saturday. Sam (shuttle driver), Ester, Ana (Bar attendants) and front desk personnel for Thursday and Friday gave us a 5 star service. Everything went down to the drain Saturday afternoon had to wait for over an hour at the train station driver and front desk attendant blamed each other. I put it behind and most definitely I would stay again good breakfast, good service overall, location, rooms are kept clean.",Good experience overall,OJ
3,"Given the location of the hotel, it wasn't a bad stay. I know the name on the outside has changed a few times but the interior hasn't changed much at all.. The over night desk clerk mumbles when he speaks making my late night check-in that much more agonising. The maintenance housekeeping crew were overly polite and courteous, loved it. The front desk clerk and manager both over night and day shifts need to take a page from their fellow employees book on manners.","Metro Points in New Carrollton, MD",A verified traveler
2,"When I looked at the pictures , I thought that I have an excellent deal at hand but it turned out to be a total let down ...This hotel is not even worth comparing to a MOTEL6 or SUPER8 . It is run down and shabby . Will not stay here ever.",Pictures do not tell the truth,A verified traveler

4,I enjoyed it. Breakfast is great although you did not have oatmeal that morning which I always love so that was not pleasant for me for breakfast. Please always have oatmeal.,Nice hotel. Right by the belt way. Close to D.C.,A verified traveler
3,"This hotel was a good value. The rooms are clean and comfortable and mine was newly upgraded. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. The only real issue is the noise...constant hammering that seemed as though it was in the room next to me. Also, the hot water in my bathroom did not function, so I ended up taking a cold shower. Needless to say, the noise and lack of hot water made for a disappointing stay from the standpoint of comfort. Still, a good value with easy parking and not too far from either DC or Baltimore if you are visiting.","Nice Remodeling Work, but Noisy",Franklin
4,"The bathtub had scratches on it that shows black rust. The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it! Yet, rooms are spacious, TV is new, internet connection is good, and so is the location. Except from B-fast time and tub condition, I liked it.",No consideration for late arrivals,A verified traveler

3,"Booked through online site and they got my name wrong over the phone but that wasn't the hotels fault. It wasn't the worst place I have stayed at all. A few problems though. The internet did not work in the room or the lobby on any of our devices, ipod, ipad, laptop, nothing. Did use the computer in the business center. They advertise a breakfast buffet in the lounge but it wasn't represented well with that title. Consisted of eggs, waffle (premade), cereal, toast so I was a little disappointed. The shuttle picked us up at the Metro 15 minutes late after I called twice. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and the room was clean.",Four day stay,A verified traveler

4,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night for the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington this past weekend. It was more than adequate for being a place to spend the night. We liked that the room and bathroom were spacious. The location was ideal for someone who drove to the area. I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation.",Great deal,Laura
5,Location is great for all budget shoppers and easy access to interstates highway. Breakfast was awesome!!,Just one dreamless sleep night!,A verified traveler
2,"There was a free breakfast buffet, but the hotel did not let us know the hours of it. When we showed up at 9:32, they said it closed at 9:30. We reserved a king sized bed and got a room with two doubles. They told us we were not guaranteed the bed choice that we wanted. There is no restaurant, lounge or bar as it says on the website. The shuttle was good to use and runs pretty much every 30 minutes up to 4:30 ish. If you need to return to the hotel after 10:10 when the shuttle stops, take a taxi. The cost was 7.50 and it was worth it. The nearest metro station is too far from D.C. Next time I will stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington again.",Four Points,A verified traveler
4,"20 Extra charge for King bed, 10 charge for a microwave in the room, but couldn't put it in because maintenance wasn't on site. The room was decent and clean. The staff was friendly enough. Another guest with body odor permeated the lobby with her essence and it was quickly addressed. Location is very convenient and the price was reasonable. We missed breakfast, so I cannot provide feedback on that.",Quick getaway away from the kids,CaliGirlnot

3,"Heater was blowing cool air in morning. Some things in the room seemed shoddy or unfinished like sprinkler, wall around the light switch, and when you first enter one of the lightswitches that I believe was meant to turn on the lamps did nothing. Also we were only there one nite but in that time our room keys both got deactivated. We were very pleased with complimentary breakfast offerings except that there was cream cheese but no bagels and the type of milks were not labeled.","Convenient for the game, a few things to improve",A verified traveler
3,"We paid for a 150.00 room but put in a room which is 75.00. I checked the rooms because my sister stayed in the 75.00 room which is exactly the same as ours. We were ripped off. The two beds in room are very small, my husband and I couldn't sleep on the same bed. One of us slept on the couch which was uncomfortable too. No more!!!",Ripped Off on ROOM PRICE,lydia
1,"The best part of the stay at Metro Points besides check out was the staff. I commend them for working in such deplorable conditions. I was extremely disappointed. From the outside, peering through the window, the hotel is beautiful. When I entered I was met by stained carpet and dirty walls. Although check in was easy (Kudos to Mr. Davis) who worked hard to accommodate me. However, he could not fix the peeling paint, the spotty drapes, the snowy picture, the no wifi the entire time I was there, the sink with no running water and the tub with no knobs. This hotel has the potential to be very good. Management cannot be oblivious to all the defects. Management needs to get it together. It's the little things that keep customers or drive them away. I drove away with no intention of ever returning.",Don't be fooled,Mrs. Ryce

3,"The suite was nice and roomy, however the carpet in the whole hotel was dirty but staff was cleaning the hall carpet before my departure.

5,There for a week and every day every staff member was very helpfull. They have a shuttle to the metro station and the drivers were very nice. They even gave us their cell to call them so we won't have to wait. The cleaning crew was always helful and friendy. The room was super and the beds were really good. Breakfast was good and you have the convenience of a 7eleven across the street to pack some water and snacks for the day. For shure we'll be back to this great hotel. THANK YOU!,Great hotel,A verified traveler
4,"I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future.","Nice place, but breakfast is so-so.",Tony

4,"The room looked like it was recently redone, it and the lobby were very attractive. But be aware that the closet rod (really a cabinet) was one foot long and there was not a single drawer for clothes. This would be a nice, reasonably priced room for one night.

There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle. Unfortunately, I didn't listen carefully to the description of where the pick up would be, so I assumed it was on the opposite side of the train tracks, and I missed it. Moral of the story: don't assume you know where the shuttle bus will pick you up. After that, The shuttle worked very well.

I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either.",Not that great,A verified traveler

2,"In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again!

El senor del shuttle habla espanol y es muy amable. El desayuno es agradable y variado. En general es un hotel recomendado para pasar unos dias, descansar y visitar la ciudad.",excelente!,Jimena
2,Great location Close to where I needed to do business. Service so-so and hotel barely accerptable. I needed hotel accomodations for 3 weeks. If the Metro had been acceptable I would have stayed the entire time. Instead I chose to stay at another hotel in GreenBelt (Holiday Inn) one exit away. Just as great a location and much better service and accomodations. Price was about the same.,Location Location Location,Sandra
3,"First on all Sam the shuttle driver was great!!!!! I can not say enough about him. To get to the hotel, you must call for the shuttle to guarantee they will arrive at their schedule times or take a taxi which should cost you 5. We were burned upon arrival with a 10 fee while he stayed on his mobile phone. Turns out the hotel is a quick 3 to 4 minute ride. The hotel is definitely too far to walk and neighborhood between metro and hotel is a bit sketchy with the apartments but the hotel is in a descant and quiet area. The check in staff did not seem too friendly nor helpful when asked about surrounding area. Once we got to know Sam, everything became better. He made sure we got got to metro station which is very convenient on time and inquired when we would return. He was there waiting!!!! Hotel is doing some remodeling but does not effect your stay. Thanks again Sam!!!!!",Good stay,A verified traveler

The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to.

4,"The hotel was surprisingly good. Our room was very clean and spacious for 2 people. The bed was extremely comfortable. I especially liked the pillows that they provided. It gave just the right amount of support to my neck to relieve the stress and fatigue after roaming in scorching Washington DC heat on 4th July weekend (100 F). Hotel staff was super helpful. As soon as we checked into our room, within half an hour hotel attendant provided couple of extra towels without requesting. I especially liked this nice gesture because anyone tired of traveling in hot weather will take a nice bath and would need extra towels for early morning next day. Breakfast was average in terms of variety and quality. Neighborhood is definitely not good. There are couple of police cars always in the Hotel campus. So walking to Metro station is out of question. I wish the free hotel shuttle frequency to metro station was like every 10 mins instead of half an hour. It hardly takes 2 mins by shuttle to reach the metro station. But if you miss it (we did miss by couple of mins, while waiting for the elevator to arrive), you have to wait half an hour for next shuttle. All in all it was nice experience. I would definitely stay again.",Nice hotel near DC,yogi

3,"It is true that you get what you pay for, the hotel staff was very friendly, but the first issue was with the AC , the hallways are like a oven, they only have 2 window AC units on each end of the hallways, when you come out of your elevator or room it is like you are getting into a sauna, ( very uncomfortable), the water pressure is very poor, it is like you take a shower with a medicine dropper and if somebody flush the toilet the water is gone until the toilet tank stop refilling, the drain in the bath tub was plug, need to call maintenance to fix it, and for last when you check in they tell you that breakfast has one type of meat in a daily basis (bacon or sausage), on my 4 days stay not even one day the meat appeared.

Back to the lobby we went to inform the staff and be moved to another room. The next room we were given was on the 5th floor. Upon entering, the tv was on, one of the TWO (again) beds was unmade. Carried all of our luggage back down to the front desk AGAIN to be moved. We were then upgraded to a suite in the seventh floor which satisfied me and made me much less angry. The room was very clean and a great size. When we went to the simon area at night to eat, we stood at the deal for ten minutes while the staff only looked at us. I finally walked over to someone and asked about eating and they informed me they were closing in 3 minutes.

5,"I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area.",Wonderful Hotel,A verified traveler

My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe.

Rooms were fairly clean, breakfast wasn't that good (always out of something), staff was helpful, check in/out was quick and painless. Free parking is a plus. Depending on the day/time its about 30-45 min to downtown DC by car. They also offer shuttle service to nearest train station till 10pm everyday. I'd pick a closer hotel to downtown, but like I said there wasn't anything below 300, 84 was a steal :)",Nice hotel,A verified traveler

You can tell that the owners and staffers care about their property and it shines through. I would absolutely stay here again. Very reasonable and a perfect location. Less then a minute from I-95.,Great Hotel-Close to Six Flags and Downtown D.C.,Kristina
3,"On Monday while watching a news program, the light went off. I waited 10mins nothing happened and I called the front desk and I was told something like: light went out in the entire New Carrollton area. That was not their fault but not to have adequate preparation and provision in case of such occurrence is unacceptable. I was unaware when the back up power came up because my room never had light until the New Carrollton light came back. Business should be business. I paid for a full service, not spending some moment in darkness. Thank you.","Terrible. No light, back up power failed the test.",A verified traveler

4,We visited for a game at FedEx field and took some time to also enjoy DC. This hotel fit out needs for both. Wish the breakfast was longer during the week for those looking to get some shuteye since it was our vacation :) we opted for Starbucks across the street instead of waking for a buffet that closed at 9am. Shuttle to metro station was super convenient. One elevator broke leaving the whole hotel to function in chaos since the stairs were only for emergency. Carpet in our room was heavy soiled and in need of replacement. Only thing missing was a pool.....,Great place to rest your head for DC getaway,Jennie
5,"Clean room and public areas, updated colors and design. Good full American breakfast (scrambled eggs were very fluffy, not soggy and runny). A 5 glass of wine at the lobby bar was extremely reasonable. Hotel had several motorcoach groups there, but the front desk seemed to process their check-in/check-out very efficiently. All staff very courteous and friendly. Hotel shuttle runs to the metro stop, so you can easily get into D.C. without driving. I'd stay here again.","Clean, Friendly, Good Value",A verified traveler
4,"The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as, comfortable rooms and breakfast. Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for 20 dollars a person. We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area, as well as my wife expecting our first baby. She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we didn't want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark. Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location, when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him, he hung up on us and a police officer, and shut off his phone. We didn't get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company. The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized. We did get half of our money back from the second driver/boss of the company. When returning to the hotel the staff didn't seem concerned with the mishap. I don't think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests. Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel.",DC trip to 9er game,Timothy Brashear

4,Visited D.C. for two days and found this to be gret for what we needed. Close to the metro and shuttle service to and from. Breakfast was ok...not that much variety but for the price adequate. Only issue we had was with the shuttle one evening we got in about two minutes after the scheduled shuttle from metro to hotel and they would not wait for us. I think a small exception could have been made to wait a minute or two at 10 pm to wait for a guest that was on the phone with you telling you that they were one stop away. Front desk just said sorry we cant wait..next shuttle will be in 30 minutes. We took a taxi and although its probably only a quarter of a mile drive it cost ten dollars. I have mixed feelings about how that situation was handled being in customer service but I can also understand that there has to be structure as well. Overall a good place to stay.. I would recommend it to friends.,cheap and convenient,Livan

3,"nice hotel ,good value being out of DC but not much around area , so if you dont mind being away from night time activity and just want a base to explore DC from it is ideal",convienient to train station for access to downtow,A verified traveler
4,The hotel is a good pick when the goal is to have a place to crash that is cheaper than the majority in the area and when you want something clean. I did appreciate the shuttle to and from the metro that was provided for free. The hotel doesn't have a lot of extras but it fit the bill for us.,Great price!,Tara
